## Test Script

`/opt/cpanel/ea-tomcat100/test.jsp` is a handy JSP test script that you can copy to try out your instance.

## How do I start/stop/etc my container?

It is managed by the `ea-podman` system.

`/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/ea-podman hint` to get started.

## I want to access my apps via URI and not need a port number

You simply need to configure your web server to proxy a given URI to the appropriate port.

For example:

* given an AJP port of `11111`
* assuming you want `example.com/testuri` to serve the test.jsp noted above

Youâ€™d need to:

1. create a `ProxyPass` include for Apache.
   * An [include for `example.com`](https://docs.cpanel.net/ea4/apache/modify-apache-virtual-hosts-with-include-files/) would look like this:
```
<IfModule proxy_ajp_module>
    ProxyPass "/testuri" "ajp://127.0.0.1:11111/test.jsp"
</IfModule>
```
2. restart apache
3. Hit example.com/testuri to ensure it took effect

**Note**: The ajp module in that example is brought in as a requirement of `ea-tomcat100`.
