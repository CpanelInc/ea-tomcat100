# ea-tomcat100 EA4 container based package

## Security

Please read https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/security-howto.html
to find ways to increase security of your tomcat instance.

## Faster Startup

Please read https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp
to find ways to improve the startup time fo your tomcat instance.

## Test Script

`/opt/cpanel/ea-tomcat100/test.jsp` is a handy JSP test script that you can copy to try out your instance.

## How do I start/stop/etc my container?

It is managed by the `ea-podman` system.

`/usr/local/cpanel/scripts/ea-podman hint` to get started.

## I want to access my apps via URI and not need a port number

You simply need to configure your web server to proxy a given URI to the appropriate port.

For example:

1. given an AJP port of `11111` (can be found in the instanceâ€™s conf/server.xml)
2. assuming you want `example.com/docs` to be your tomcat apps

An [include for `example.com`](https://docs.cpanel.net/ea4/apache/modify-apache-virtual-hosts-with-include-files/) would look like this:

```
<IfModule proxy_ajp_module>
    ProxyPass "/docs" "ajp://127.0.0.1:11111/docs"
</IfModule>
```

Just restart apache and it should take effect.

**Note**: The ajp module in that example is brought in as a requirement of \`ea-tomcat100`.
